# Pave the Way

The task of improving communities is one that requires a great amount of research and planning. To execute this planning, local governments and community leaders first need reliable data to be able to understand the issues they are trying to address. Currently, there is no product on the market that specifically addresses gathering and visualizing this kind of data. Auditors have to manually collect data, and there is no possibility of crowdsourcing this collection. Our team hopes to change that. 

We are building a product to help measure the extent to which lower income communities need assistance by allowing the benchmarking of relevant street-level data, such as property condition, within these communities.

Our solution is an Android application that allows for easy data collection by the Hampton Roads community in Virginia.
